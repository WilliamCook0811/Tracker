# Tracker
Tracker is a reflex-based game that challenges players to manage an increasing number of randomly placed "X" buttons on the screen. The game follows a simple yet engaging mechanic: players must click on each X before too many accumulate. The game dynamically adapts by continuously spawning new buttons every 0.25 seconds while enforcing spatial constraints on placement. Players win by successfully removing 100 Xs but lose if 10 or more remain on the screen simultaneously.

# Winning the Game:
Successfully Click 100 Boxes without letting too many appear on screen at once.

# Losing the game:
By allowing 10 squares to appear on screen, you will have lost the game.
